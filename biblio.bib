  Abstract                 = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.}

  Abstract                 = {{For many years, theories of collaborative learning tended to focus on how individuals function in a group. More recently, the focus has shifted so that the group itself has become the unit of analysis. In terms of empirical research, the initial goal was to establish whether and under what circumstances collaborative learning was more effective than learning alone. Researchers controlled several independent variables (size of the group, composition of the group, nature of the task, communication media, and so on). However, these variables interacted with one another in a way that made it almost impossible to establish causal links between the conditions and the effects of collaboration. Hence, empirical studies have more recently started to focus less on establishing parameters for effective collaboration and more on trying to understand the role which such variables play in mediating interaction. In this chapter, we argue that this shift to a more process-oriented account requires new tools for analysing and modelling interactions.}},

  Notes                    = {- The "Ann and Sally" experiment. A child watches this scene: Ann watches Sally to put an object in a basket. Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to the table. The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},
